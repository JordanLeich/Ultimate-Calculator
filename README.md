# Description üíª
This is an incredibly powerful calculator and converter that is capable of many useful day-to-day functions that typical calculators cannot perform. Such functions include solving basic arithmetic, algebraic problems, chemistry unit conversions, and much more. This project also features a fully operational GUI application for those who are not down with the normal text-based version.

# Contributing üëç
1. If you decide on contributing to the project, please do not bother opening a pull request that reformats and changes the look of the code just because you do not like how it looks, or you type python code differently than me. I have already had numerous contributors reformat/optimize the code for this project.
